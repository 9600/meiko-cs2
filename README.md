### Meiko CS/2 Computing Surface Linux port

This repo contains assorted artifacts from a port of Linux
to the Meiko CS/2 Computing Surface circa 1999-2000.
The main bits here are some manuals, low level arch support
for the dino1 compute board, drivers and utilities for the
bargraph and can network.

The elan1 comms processor is conspicuously unsupported by
this Linux port; Linux really took off at LLNL at this point
and our efforts focused on new hardware - the Quadrics elan3/4,
which was the primary interconnect for our first production
Linux clusters.
