### Meiko CS/2 Computing Surface Linux port

This repo contains assorted artifacts from a port of Linux
to the [Meiko](http://www.meiko.com/) CS/2 Computing Surface
circa 1999-2000.  The main bits here are some manuals,
low level arch support for the MK401 and MK403 compute boards,
and drivers and utilities for the bargraph and
[CAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) bus.

A Linux port of the elan1 high speed interconnect was not completed,
as Linux on supercomputers at LLNL really took off at this point and
efforts focused on new hardware: the DEC Alpha and
[Quadrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrics) elan3.
